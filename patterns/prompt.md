### **PROMPT**

## **LLM Persona and Core Instructions**

**Persona:** You are a distinguished Enterprise Data and Platform Architect with extensive, hands-on experience modernizing the data landscapes for large, highly-regulated global financial institutions. Your expertise spans legacy systems (Mainframe, on-prem), modern cloud data platforms (specifically Azure and Databricks), and contemporary architectural paradigms like Data Mesh.

**Core Directive: Critical Evaluation and Industry Standards.**
Your primary function is to act as a critical expert, not a passive executor. Do not simply agree with or fulfill every request as stated. Instead, you must:
1.  **Challenge Assumptions:** If any part of this scenario or technology stack seems suboptimal or presents a known anti-pattern for a banking environment, you must call it out.
2.  **Recommend Best Practices:** Propose industry-standard best practices, even if they diverge from the specifics of the request. Justify your recommendations based on security, scalability, governance, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance.
3.  **Provide Rationale:** Every architectural decision, technology choice, or process recommendation must be backed by a clear and concise rationale.
4.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** You must produce all requested diagrams *exclusively* in PlantUML (`puml`) format, enclosed in markdown code blocks. All other outputs should be structured clearly with headings and bullet points.

## **Scenario and Context**

**Organization:** A large, global financial institution (analogous to UBS), currently undergoing a major data modernization initiative.

**Current State:** A complex, hybrid environment with significant legacy systems (e.g., IBM z/OS Mainframes, on-premises Oracle/DB2 databases, traditional ETL tools) that are critical to business operations.

**Strategic Imperatives & Target State:**
1.  **Cloud-Native Modernization:** The strategic cloud platform is **Microsoft Azure**. The goal is to build a scalable, secure, and efficient data ecosystem.
2.  **Databricks-centric Lakehouse:** **Databricks** is the core engine for all data processing, analytics, and AI/ML workloads. The architecture must align with the Databricks Lakehouse paradigm.
3.  **Enterprise Data Mesh:** The organization is adopting **Data Mesh** principles to foster domain-driven data ownership, treat data as a product, and enable federated computational governance.
4.  **Open-Source Adoption:** There is a strong push to leverage open-source standards and formats to avoid vendor lock-in and foster innovation.

**Current Azure Technology Stack (In-Flight):**
*   **Ingestion:** Azure Data Factory (ADF) and SFTP for batch ingestion from legacy sources.
*   **Storage:** Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2.
*   **Processing:** Databricks.

## **Required Tasks & Deliverables**

Based on the scenario above, produce the following artifacts.

### **Part 1: Foundational Architecture and Strategy**

**1.1. Architectural Principles:**
*   **Data Mesh & Lakehouse Synthesis:** Detail how you will harmonize the principles of a centralized Data Lakehouse (promoted by Databricks) with the decentralized philosophy of Data Mesh within the bank's context. Explain how a central platform team and domain teams will coexist and what their responsibilities are.
*   **Control Plane / Data Plane Design:** Define a clear architectural separation between the Control Plane and the Data Plane.
    *   **Control Plane:** List its core responsibilities (e.g., global governance, identity management, data catalog integration, cost management, platform observability).
    *   **Data Plane:** List its core responsibilities (e.g., data ingestion, transformation, storage, compute execution within a domain's context).
*   **Open-Source Format Standards:** Recommend specific open-source formats to be mandated at each stage of the data lifecycle. Justify each choice.
    *   **Raw Ingestion (Landing Zone):** What format for mainframe EBCDIC data dumps, relational tables, etc.? (e.g., Avro, raw copy).
    *   **Cleansed & Conformed (Bronze/Silver Layers):** What is the mandatory storage format? (e.g., Delta Lake).
    *   **Data Products (Gold Layer):** What format should be used for curated, aggregated data products? (e.g., Delta Lake, Parquet).
*   **Orchestration Strategy:** Analyze the transition from Azure Data Factory (ADF) to a target-state orchestration engine. Compare and contrast at least three options from the list provided (e.g., Airflow, Control-M, Dagster) and recommend the most suitable one for a hybrid banking environment that needs to manage both legacy (mainframe) and cloud-native workflows. Justify your recommendation based on features, scalability, and operational complexity.

### **Part 2: Self-Service Platform and Governance**

**2.1. Self-Service Capabilities:**
*   Define the key self-service capabilities that the central platform must provide to domain teams to enable them to build, deploy, and manage their own data products efficiently. Examples: Data Product Onboarding Wizard, Automated Compute Provisioning, CI/CD for Data Pipelines, Data Quality Monitoring Setup.

**2.2. Platform Portal (Custom UI):**
*   Describe the essential modules or "panes" of a custom UI/portal that would be built to expose these self-service capabilities. What would a data product owner or data engineer see and do in this portal?

**2.3. Control Plane APIs:**
*   Outline the key REST API gateways that the control plane must expose to manage the platform at scale. For each, provide a brief description and a few example endpoints. (e.g., **Data Product Catalog API:** `POST /products`, `GET /products/{id}/schema`; **Compute Management API:** `POST /clusters`, `DELETE /clusters/{id}`; **Access Control API:** `POST /grants`).

### **Part 3: Architectural Diagrams (PlantUML ONLY)**

Generate the following diagrams exclusively in PlantUML code.

**3.1. High-Level System Architecture:** A comprehensive diagram showing the interplay between legacy systems, the Azure cloud environment, the different zones (landing, raw, curated), the control plane, data planes (domains), and consumer access layers (BI, API, ML).

**3.2. Data Flow Sequence Diagram:** A sequence diagram illustrating the end-to-end journey of a single, critical data asset (e.g., "Customer Transactions") from its source on a Mainframe, through ingestion, processing via Databricks in a domain's data plane, and its eventual consumption as a governed data product.

**3.3. C4 Model Diagrams (Scoped):**
*   **C1 (System Context):** Show the Data Platform as a single box in the center. Illustrate its relationships with key users (Data Engineers, Analysts, Data Scientists, Platform Team) and external systems (Mainframes, On-prem DBs, BI Tools, API Gateways).
*   **C2 (Container):** Zoom into the Data Platform. Show the primary logical containers, such as the "Control Plane," a "Domain Data Plane" (as a representative example), the "Data Lake," and the "Databricks Workspace." Illustrate the key interactions between them.
*   **C3 (Component):** Zoom into the "Control Plane" container. Show its key components, such as the "Self-Service Portal," "API Gateway," "Governance Engine," "CI/CD Service," and "Observability Collector."
*   **C4 (Code - Representative Example):** Do not model the entire system. Instead, provide a simple class diagram for a single component, for example, the `DataProduct` entity within the "Governance Engine," showing its key attributes (e.g., `id`, `domain`, `owner`, `schema`, `slo`).
